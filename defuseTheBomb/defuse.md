# defuse the bomb!

Now for this problem the logic was a bit more interesting seeing as we had 3 cases [ 1 of which was negligible ] and for that reason it was a bit more fun to play around and prod with the solutions, although my final solution is not very good after some poking around on the internet i found something a bit more satisfactory.

for example we do not have to make an array that is k times larger than the original, we can just pop and append the number to the end / beginning of the array, I think I will attempt to improve upon my original in the future
